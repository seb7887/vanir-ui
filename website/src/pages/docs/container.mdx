import { Container } from 'vanir-ui'
```

## Usage

<Example>
  <Container>
    There are many benefits to a joint design and development system. Not only
    does it bring benefits to the design team, but it also brings benefits to
    engineering teams. It makes sure that our experiences have a consistent look
    and feel, not just in our design specs, but in production
  </Container>
