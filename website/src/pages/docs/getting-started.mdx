import { Button } from 'vanir-ui'

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

You must have installed Tailwind with Tailwind Forms plugin.

## Installation

Inside your React project directory, install Vanir UI by running either of the following:

```bash
npm i vanir-ui
```

```bash
yarn add vanir-ui
```

## Set up Provider

For Vanir UI to work correctly, you need to set up the _VanirUIProvider_ at the root of your application.

Go to the root of your application and do this:

```tsx
import React from 'react'
// 1. Import `VanirUIProvider` component
import { VanirUIProvider } from 'vanir-ui'

const App: React.FC = ({ children }) => {
  // 2. Use at the root of your app
  return <VanirUIProvider>{children}</VanirUIProvider>
}
```
